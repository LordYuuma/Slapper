Slapper
=======

The most extensible IRC /slap you have ever seen

Installing:
----------
Run `(sudo) python setup.py install` to install the modules needed for this to work. Then move
`slapper.py` into your hexchat plugin directory.

Usage:
------
To slap one (or multiple) target(s) use `/slap <target(s)>`. All of your targets will then be
slapped (one slap statement for everyone to prevent spamming). To specify a slapper, that is
not a trout, use `/slap -s <slapper> <target(s)>`. Slapper and targets are seperated by spaces,
but you can quote them or escape the spaces to specify a longer name. Whenever you feel like
needing help use `/slap --help`.
