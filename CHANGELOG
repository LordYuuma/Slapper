2.2:
    Added {name} (the name of the slapobject, not it's represented value) to the replacable
    keys, hooray for recursive algorithms based on this.
2.1:
    Representing preference list as key => value dictionary instead of an array
    Removing hardcoded zero commands (instead "default" is used, when there is no key available)
2.0:
    more code density, using lambdas where useful
    added interaction with python console
1.0:
    not really usable code blob, core functionality
